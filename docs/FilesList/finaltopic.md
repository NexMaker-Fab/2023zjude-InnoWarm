# OperaFace: Digitized Opera Face Changing Toys Based on Emotion Recognition

## Background:
Sichuan Opera Face Changing is one of the stunts used in Sichuan Opera performances, which is used to reveal the inner feelings and thoughts of the characters in the play, i.e., to turn the invisible and imperceptible abstract emotions and psychological states into visible and perceptible concrete images - face paintings. Face painting is a kind of stunt used in the art of Sichuan Opera to portray characters and reveal the inner thoughts and feelings of the characters in the play as a kind of romanticism technique.

We proposed to use facial expression recognition methods to simulate the corresponding Sichuan opera face expressions on digital led masks, to help users better understand the cultural connotations of Sichuan opera face changing and the emotional knowledge it contains; to help users better understand the emotional expression, which can be applied to children's emotional education sessions.
