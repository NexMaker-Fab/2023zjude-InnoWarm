Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi is designed for learning computer programming education, a miniature computer the size of a credit card, with its system based on Linux. With the release of IoT, users can now use Raspberry Pi running Windows. It has complete computing capabilities, capable of running operating systems similar to desktop computers. 

Raspberry Pi is commonly used in various projects, including smart home systems, media centers, gaming machines, and servers.

BeagleBoard

BeagleBoard is a low-power open-source single-board computer jointly produced by Texas Instruments with Digi-Key and Newark. It is designed for open-source software development and serves as a demonstration of the Texas Instruments OMAP3530 system-on-a-chip. Similar to Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard is also a low-cost, open-source hardware platform that provides a complete single-board computer solution. 

BeagleBoard is commonly used in fields such as embedded system development, robotics, medical equipment, and industrial control.

ESP32

ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power microcontroller units that integrate Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. The ESP32 series adopts the Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor, including dual-core and single-core versions, with built-in antenna switches, RF RF modules, power amplifiers, low-noise receive amplifiers, filters, and power management modules. Currently, the product models in the ESP32 series include ESP32 S2 (single-core + 2.4G Wi-Fi), ESP32 S3 (dual-core + 2.4G Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 5), ESP32 C2 (single-core + 2.4G Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 5), ESP32 C3 (single-core + 2.4G Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 5), and traditional ESP32 modules.

ESP32 is widely used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications and projects. They can be used as standalone microcontrollers or as wireless communication modules for other main controllers.
