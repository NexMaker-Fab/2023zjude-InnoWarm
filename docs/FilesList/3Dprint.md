# 5.3 Problems and solutions

**Problem 1:** In the stage of adjusting model parameters, after turning on the support, there will be a printing error and the model will disappear.

**Solution:** Cancel support.

<div class="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Mia1210-my/MY/raw/main/img/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8717.png"  width="800">
</div>


**Problem 2:** Initially, I wanted to try printing the head and body of a small shark together in one file to save printing time. However, the fish head didn't stick to the panel during the actual printing, resulting in a mess of lines as the fish head failed to print.

**Solution:** The fish head was eventually reprinted in two files.

    <img src="https://github.com/Mia1210-my/MY/raw/main/img/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8718.png"  width="800">
</div>


**Problem 3:** Preparing to print the fish head when the material line jam, we removed the heating head to clean the broken line and adjust the material line of the tray did not solve the problem.

**Solution:** We finally sought help from the instructor to fix the printer.

</div>


**Problem 4:** During the tilt model test phase, the printer reports an error when printing the model after adding support.

**Solution:** Print after cancelling the support.
